# Air Quality Analysis Project - README

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comparative analysis of air quality across multiple cities in North America and Central America. Using data from OpenAQ (Open Air Quality), the analysis investigates air quality patterns, trends, and variations between urban centers with different geographical and environmental characteristics.

## Cities Analyzed
- Costa Rica (primary focus)
- Surrey, Canada
- Anaheim, US
- Reseda, US
- Seattle, US
- Boston, US

## Data Science Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Data Collection & API Integration
- Implemented API calls to OpenAQ for real-time air quality data retrieval
- Utilized both direct HTML extraction and Python wrapper approaches
- Managed API authentication and request structuring

### 2. Data Processing & Wrangling
- Cleaned and preprocessed environmental data from multiple sources
- Handled time series data with date-time manipulations
- Normalized datasets for cross-regional comparisons

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Applied time-series analysis techniques to identify trends
- Conducted statistical comparisons between different urban environments
- Normalized for seasonal and temporal factors affecting measurements

### 4. Data Visualization
- Created informative matplotlib visualizations to represent air quality patterns
- Implemented time-series plots using matplotlib.dates
- Designed comparative visualizations to highlight regional differences

### 5. Environmental Data Analysis
- Analyzed particulate matter and air quality indicators across regions
- Investigated relationships between urban development and air quality
- Assessed seasonal variations in pollutant concentrations

## Technical Implementation
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following key libraries:
- `requests` - For API data retrieval
- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` - For visualization and graphing
- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- `datetime` - For time series handling

## Project Structure
The Jupyter notebook follows a logical progression through:
1. Dataset extraction from OpenAQ
2. Data cleaning and preparation
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Statistical testing and comparison
5. Visualization of findings
6. Conclusion and environmental implications

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed significant patterns in air quality variations between urban centers, with notable differences between Costa Rican measurements and those from North American cities. The project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to environmental monitoring and analysis.

## Future Work
Additional analysis could extend this work through:
- Predictive modeling of air quality based on historical patterns
- Integration with meteorological data to assess weather impacts
- Machine learning approaches to identify key factors influencing air quality

This project showcases proficiency in working with environmental data, API integration, statistical analysis, and data visualization - all key skills in the modern data science toolkit.
